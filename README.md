FileHatchery
------------

Simple file explorer for windows.
(Actually it's a crappy clone of NexusFile, sry)

## Features

* File browsing
  * Simple feature... isn't it?
* Vim-style console support
  * Try enter ":edit this" if you have installed gvim in your PC.
  * If above works, try ":sudo edit this", then you will be amused.

## Installation

* Download [Link](https://github.com/blmarket/filehatchery/releases/download/0.1.0/FileHatchery.zip)
* Extract
* Run FileHatchery.exe

## TODO

* Lots of UI improvements
* Console auto completion
* Is there someone who will make me a Icon?
